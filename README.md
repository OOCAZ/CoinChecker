# CoinChecker
Just a little side project for checking current stats about crypto currrencies.

Use a React Native base and the axios library to handle API calls.

This is a great project to fiddle with if you are just getting into React Native or even for those of you experienced enough to do this often.

For general info on REact Native visit: https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis

This has been tested by myself ot work on Android and Web. Will conitnue testing and test on iOS soon.

The UI needs work and I will offer that up to those who want to try to make it nice. 

Will also be adding icons and the like so that we can upload this to the app stores soon.
